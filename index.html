       <p>Amanuel Haile here reporting for duty! I did not ever think I would be writing my bio on a website template through a coding resource. I never thought I would be coding even if I am being frank. I was always interested in literature and learning history but I keep those as hobbies and not my career. </p>
       
       <p>I’ve always been an introverted extrovert which means I’m great at parties once you get to know me. But that is something I’ve been working on in social settings, really just not putting unnecessary pressure on myself for no reason. My motto is let things flow and they will come to you.</p>

       <h3>Page Origin</h3>

       <p>Remaining positive and practical is a great reason to keep me around because I tend not to get overwhelmed. I am not afraid to work hard or put in the hours and I create schedules and timelines to make big projects easier for myself and my team. I was originally a Political Science (pre-law) major which I thought would eventually land me into law school. Over time I lost my passion and this is what has landed me into the tech field.</p>
